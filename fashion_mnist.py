# Fashion-MNIST Neural Network

This notebook implements a simple NN consisting of two dense layers, and uses this network to classify Fashion-MNIST images.

These Fashion-MNIST images consist of clothing items from these ten classes. (*T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, Ankle boot)*

## Get Data

### About the Fashion-MNIST dataset

The Fashion-MNIST dataset is a widely available dataset.  It is documented at the https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist

Each image in the dataset is 28 X 28 pixels.  The pixel values are a grayscale with values ranging from 0 to 255.

Associated with each image is a number from 0 to 9 specifying the class of the fashion item in the image.  The values for the classes are:

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 0     | T-shirt/top |
|   1    | Trouser    | 
|  2     |  Pullover  |
|   3    |    Dress    |
|    4   |    Coat      |
|   5    | Sandal     |
|   6    | Shirt         |
|    7   |  Sneaker  |
|   8    |  Bag          |
|  9     | Ankle boot |

There are 60,000 Training examples and 10,000 Testing examples.

We will need these class names later in the code.  So we create an list of names we can index by the class label number.  For example, class_names[2] = 'Pullover' and class_names[9] = 'Ankle boot'.
"""

We can now create the model we are going to train with the data.

This will be a simple model that:

* Passes each pixel value as the input to each of the 128 neurons.  
* And finally passes values to the last layer that contains 10 neurons, one for each of the ten classes (t-shirt, pullover, etc).  Each of these 10 neurons uses the Softmax activation function to determine the probability that the image is each class.  The final output from the model is a vector of probabilities that the image is of each class.  Such as :
[0.01, 0.05, 0.04, 0.06, 0.50, 0.20, 0.04, 0.00, 0.03, 0.07].  This example vector adds up to 1.0 and shows the probability that the image is class 0 (T-shirt/top) is 0.01 (1%), class 1 (Trousers) is 0.05 (5%), class 2 (Pullover) is 0.04 (4%), ....

*     optimizer - how the model will update the model's weights to reduce the loss.  We use the Adam variant of Mini-batch Gradient Descent.
* metrics  - the metrics used for evaluation of training and test.  In this case we use accuracy, that is how often the images are correctly classified.  Higher is better. (1.00 would be perfect (100%), 0,75 = 75%, 0.25 = 25%, ...)

The model has **about 96% accuracy** on the training data.  And **only 88% accuracy** on testing data on which it was not trained. This is a classic sign that the model overfits the training data.

# Monitoring and Improving our Trained Modelâ€™s Performance 

In this section, we want to make changes to improve the performance of our trained model.  By improved performance we mean having the model not overfit the training data and perform poorly on the testing data.

There are serveral common techniques to fix this problem.  These include:

1.   Reducing Model Complexity - removing neurons or layers
2.   Dropout - Randomly removing the contributions from some neurons
3.   Early Stopping - Terminating training as early as possible

We will try these below.

## Monitoring performance with TensorBoard

We want to ensure we are getting good data to evaluate the performance of our changes.  Fortunately the TensorFlow family include the tool **TensorBoard**.  

TensorBoard provides us various ways to monitor the performance of our models including:

*    Visualizing metrics such as loss and accuracy
*    Comparision of training and evaluation metrics
*    Visualizing the model graph (ops and layers)
*    Viewing histograms of weights, biases, or other tensors as they change over time

TensorBoard can be run inside a Colab notebook, or if you are running your code directly in Python you can invoke TensorBoard from the command line.

"""### Implementing Early Stopping

Early stopping involves having the training stop when the model has been trained enough.  

Often training is slow in terms of time, and expensive in terms of compute time on big clusters or a cloud service.  So it is useful to be able to stop training as soon as reasonable.  And reasonable is usually when the metric like lose quits decreasing.  So the question is, how can we know when the loss quits decreasing?  

We could run a bunch of trials and use a tool like TensorBoard to plot curves.  But it is tedious to write a model with 20 epochs, run it, see loss was decreasing, then repeat that with 40 epochs, etc.  Worse, if we change the model or it's parameters, like adjusting the dropout percentage, the number of epochs required to see when the loss stops decreasing might be different.

So what we need is an automated way to detect when training has quit improving and terminate training.  And fortunately Keras has an early stopping feature that does just this!

We start with the same model, optimizer, loss, and log clearing code as before.
